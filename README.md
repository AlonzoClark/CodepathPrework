Some ideas to improve the app are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, text fields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

App that I might consider building - I was thinking about making an app that allows you to track/document your habits/lifestyle and try to do more beneficial things for the world. For example: You could get points/rewards for taking public transportation and this would help with pollution; You could document how many pieces of trash you picked up and receive points;

I also think that having fitness tips/workouts for people to follow would be pretty useful as well.
